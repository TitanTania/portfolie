        <h4>Get to know more about me, the one and only TLind</h4>

        <p>My name is Tania Lind. I am 20 years old (even though i dont look like it)and i am currently studying as a multimedia designer at Lillebealt Academy University of Applied Scienes in Odense, Denmark.</p>
        <p>I moved to Denmark from the Philippines when i was about 10 years old and ever since it has been a blast living here. It has been difficult learning a whole new language but so far i would say that im doing well.</p>

        <p>There is nothing special about me. I am just like anybody out there. I like to play videogames, watch movies or series in my free time. I also like being together with my family and friends.</p>

        <p>I believe that to have a good time whether its at home or work, there always has to be room for fun. Dont get me wrong, it is important to be serious and engaded at work, but sometimes you just need to give your self one moment to live a little.</p>

        <p>I am currently living in Svendborg with my fiance.</p>
